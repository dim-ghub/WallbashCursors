# WallbashCursors
A shell and python script to generate x11 and hyprcursors for HyDE using wallbash

This will NOT be executed automatically bc its a long process, run the shell script manually when you wanna generate new cursors

Make the scripts executable then extract the base cursor pack.

Refresh wallbash/hyde in whatever way works best for you

Then run the shell script to generate the pack.

These are the supported sizes:

24
30
48
60
72
96
120
144
240
